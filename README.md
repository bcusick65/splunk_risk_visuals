# splunk_risk_visuals
- Visualization repo for Splunk and ES

Requirements
- Splunk Security Essentials v3.2.0+
- Splunk Enterprise Security 6.4.x+

This app was created to remove the requirement for SA-RBA as most RBA functionality is now included in Splunk's Enterprise Security.
While updated risk dashboards and visualizations are not yet included in ES, this app is built to fill that gap, specifically around mapping risk to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
